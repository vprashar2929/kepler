  #  Interval is the monitor's refresh interval. All process that

  # Staleness is the duration after the data that is computed by the monitor
  # in each refresh is considered stale and recomputed when requested again.
  #
  # This is especially useful if you have multiple prometheus instances
  # (in a HA) scrapping kepler and the data received by both instances will be
  # the same as long as the scrapes happens within the staleness duration.

  # NOTE: Keep staleness shorter than the monitor interval.
